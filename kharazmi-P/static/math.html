    <h1>What is Mathematics?</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Mathematics is the abstract science of numbers, quantity, and space, either as abstract concepts (pure mathematics), or as applied to other disciplines such as physics and engineering (applied mathematics).
        </p>

        <p>
            It is a universal language that helps us describe, analyze, and predict the patterns we observe in the world around us. From the basic counting of numbers to complex equations used in modern physics, mathematics serves as a tool to better understand and shape our reality.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is Mathematics Important?</h2>
        <p>
            Mathematics is vital for a variety of reasons:
